In your README.md file, write something like:
# HTML Beginner Project
This is my first web development project for ICUIWD.
I used HTML to create a basic website with a heading, paragraph, and examples from topics
like:
- HTML Colors
- HTML Comments
- HTML Quotations
I created this using Visual Studio Code and will push it to GitHub.
